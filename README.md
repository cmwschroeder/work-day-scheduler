# work-day-scheduler

## Description

In this workplace scheduler you will be able to write down what you are doing in the day and have it saved into your local machine. When you load the page for the first time all of the fields will be empty, but you will be able to type in these fields and have your messages saved. There will be 9 areas for the 9 hours in a regular 9-5 workday. Each field will be associated with a different hour of the day starting at 9 am and going to 5 pm. Just type in any box and click the button and your schedule will be saved.  
The text fields in each hour will be color coded based on what time it is. Any past hours in the day the page is being accessed will be colored gray. Any future hours will be colored green. The present hour will be colored red. If you are accessing this page before 9 all hours will be green, and likewise after 5 all will be gray. The date in the top will always be the current day that the page is being accessed.  
There are limitations to this page. When an event is saved then it will be saved not just for that day but every day the page is being accessed. As in if you set a schedule for the day that is is, for example April 9th, and then access the webpage tomorrow, the same schedule from the day before will be shown.
